Basic hierarchy for move priority:

1.Move that wins the game
    Completing a 5 streak
2.Move that blocks opponent winning
    Cutting opponent 4 streak
3.Moves that set up win next turn
    Setting up double 4 streak
4.Moves that block opponent win turn later
    Cutting tiles that give more than one opponent 4 streak
5.Offensive or defensive strategy moves chosen randomly

Stuff to implement:

Need to detect streaks for player and AI all the time
Streaks should not have to be continuous, any configuration of 5 of open and single color tiles is a streak
Streaks should only count as separate if they have at least 1 different open tile
Offensive moves should add more instances of the longest streak or make existing longest streak longer
Defensive moves should cut opponent longest streak
If possible should give priority to tiles that multiple opponent or own streaks share
